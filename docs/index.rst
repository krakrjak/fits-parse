If you use FITS files in your work or play and you use Hakell, or would like
to, then *fits-parse* just might be the library you've been looking for. This
project is still very young and only really works on the example FITS file it
ships with, but this will improve and may already be better than anticipated.

In the **examples** folder in the source distribution you can find usage of 
the library. The *omnibus* program glues together the basics and does logging
and is intended to be a kitchen sink sort of example program.

`Haddock Docs <https://krakrjak.github.io/fits-parse/index.html>`_ are the API docs for the project.
